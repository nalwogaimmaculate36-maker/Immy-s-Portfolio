### 💡 What I Learned
This project helped me strengthen my SQL skills across data cleaning, analysis, and automation. I learned how to structure queries for clarity, build reusable procedures, and uncover meaningful insights from raw data. It also taught me the importance of designing scalable workflows — something I’m excited to apply in future projects.
